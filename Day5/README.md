#### Explain about the Object Model and why it's (Very) relevant for modern web-development
The **Document object model** or "DOM" refers to the "Live" version of the website the user is seeing.  
The browser parses our code and markup to a webpage that (Can) consist of HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.  
The combination of the elements that make the webpage is refered to as the DOM.  

Years back, a browser would parse HTML and CSS and display a completely static website once everything was loaded.  
With programming like Javascript we are able to manipulate the webpage on the client-side (Done by the browser engine) *after* the page is loaded!.  


#### Explain (using an example of your own choice) about JavaScript events, and Event Bubbling
Event bubbling is a way to propogate an event through a "Hierocracy" of elements.  
An event can propogate or "Bubble" up through elements which allows for detecting where the event took place.
This snippet clearly demonstrates the functionality:
